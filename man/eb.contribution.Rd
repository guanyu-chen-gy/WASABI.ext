\title{Expected Binder Contribution}
\usage{
eb.contribution(Zmat, Zhat, a = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Zmat}{Integer matrix: S rows (samples) by n columns (data points), each row a clustering.}

\item{Zhat}{Integer vector: length-n partition to compare.}

\item{a}{Parameter for generalized Binder, takes value between 0 and 2, a = 1 by default (regular loss).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length n: expected VI contribution for \code{Zhat} (each element).
}
\description{
Calculates the EB contribution of each observation to the expected Binder distance between a partition and samples.
}
