#' Computes the Wassertein distance between the empirical posterior and the WASABI distribution
#'
#' @param cls.draw A matrix of the MCMC samples of partitions of $n$ data points.
#' @param part The WASABI particles. A matrix of dimension $L Ã— n$ containing the particles obtained by WASABI in each of the rows.
#' @param part.weights A vector of length $L$ containing the weights associated to each of the particles.
#' @param assign.vi A vector containing the assignment of each sample \code{cls.draw} to a region of attraction (and the corresponding particle). It is obtained as output from WASABI.
#' @return The Wasserstein-VI distance between the empirical posterior distribution (supported on the MCMC samples) and the WASABI distribution.
